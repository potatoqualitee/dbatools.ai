# Presenter Notes for PowerShell OpenAI Integration Demo

## General Tips
- Make sure you have the OpenAI API key set in your environment before starting the demo
- If running commands, consider using mock data or read-only operations to avoid modifying production systems
- Pause after each highlight to let the audience absorb the information

## Section 1: Wrappers vs Integrations
- Emphasize the key differences between simple wrappers and deep integrations
- Point out that integrations provide more value by understanding system context
- Highlight real-world examples like dbatools.ai that demonstrate the benefits

## Section 2: OpenAI API Basics
- Explain that while PSOpenAI simplifies API calls, understanding the raw implementation helps with troubleshooting
- Note that setting default parameters can make scripts cleaner and more maintainable
- Mention that model availability changes over time, so checking available models is important

## Section 3: Assistants
- Explain that assistants are more powerful than simple chat completions because they maintain state
- Demonstrate how file attachments enhance the assistant's capabilities
- Point out that assistants can be shared across an organization for consistent AI interactions

## Section 4: dbatools.ai Features
- Emphasize how dbatools.ai bridges the gap between natural language and database operations
- Show how structured output with JSON schemas ensures consistent and reliable results
- Highlight the time-saving benefits of natural language database queries

## Section 5: dbatools.ai Commands
- Demonstrate how these commands make complex database operations accessible to non-experts
- Show real examples of translating natural language to SQL or PowerShell commands
- Emphasize the productivity gains from using AI-assisted database management

## Potential Questions to Address
1. How secure is the API key handling?
2. What are the costs associated with using these models?
3. How does the system handle ambiguous queries?
4. Can these techniques be applied to other domains beyond databases?
5. How does performance compare to writing queries manually?
