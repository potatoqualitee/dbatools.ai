# **Wrappers and Integrations**

| Aspect | **Wrapper** | **Integration** |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | Makes API calls simpler | Adds AI capabilities to existing tools |
| **Complexity** | Basic layer over the API | Works deeply with application code |
| **System Awareness** | Works without knowing system state or data | Uses system data like database schemas for smarter responses |
| **Use Cases** | Basic prompt handling and responses | Natural language commands, data importing |
| **Examples** | PSOpenAI, finetuna, aitoolkit | dbatools.ai, PSHelp.Copilot |

### **Benefits of Integration**

- **Efficiency**: Saves time by automating complex tasks
- **Accessibility**: Helps non experts handle advanced operations using simple language
- **Intelligence**: Makes better decisions by understanding your system data

The main goal of AI integration is to make both development and usage more natural through everyday language.
