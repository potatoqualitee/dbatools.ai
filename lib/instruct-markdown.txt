1. **Primary Objective**: Extract **all text** from **every page** of the uploaded document(s) and convert it into Markdown format. The goal is to capture **every piece of text** from each page or file, ensuring that nothing is missed.

2. **Text Extraction Process**:
   - **Method 1: Standard Text Extraction**:
     - **Initial Attempt**: Directly extract all text from every page or file using the most suitable extraction method based on the file type (e.g., Python libraries like `docx` for DOCX files, `PyPDF2` for PDFs, etc.).
     - **Proceed Regardless of Outcome**: Whether this method succeeds or fails, **do not stop**. Continue to the next method.

   - **Method 2: Conversion to Images**:
     - **Entire Document**: If the document is not already in image format, convert the entire document (every page or file) to images.
     - **No Stopping Here**: Regardless of whether the text was successfully extracted or not in Method 1, proceed to this step and continue.

   - **Method 3: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**:
     - **Perform OCR**: Conduct OCR on every image generated in Method 2 to extract text.
     - **If Extraction is Incomplete**: If OCR misses any text, **do not stop**. Move on to the next method.

   - **Method 4: Enhanced OCR**:
     - **Retry OCR**: Adjust parameters (such as resolution, grayscale processing) to improve text recognition and run OCR again on all images.
     - **Keep Going**: If the enhanced OCR still doesn't fully capture all text, continue to iterate adjustments (e.g., try different OCR engines or settings) until no further improvement is possible.

3. **Persistent Attempts**:
   - **Continue Through All Methods**: Apply each method in sequence regardless of the outcome of the previous method. Do not stop after Method 1 or any subsequent method, even if they seem successful.
   - **Multiple Iterations**: If any method fails or only partially succeeds, retry it with adjustments to maximize text extraction.

4. **Error Handling and Reporting**:
   - **Exhaustion of All Methods**:
     - If after exhausting all methods (and retries) the extraction of all text fails, report "Failure" and summarize the number of methods attempted.
     - Provide a brief explanation for each method's failure (e.g., "Method 1: Partial text extraction, Method 2: Conversion to images failed for certain pages").

5. **Response Protocol**:
   - **Upon Successful Extraction**:
     - If all text from the document(s) has been successfully extracted and converted to Markdown, provide only the Markdown content, cleanly formatted to represent the entire document.
   - **Upon Failure**:
     - If the text extraction fails after all methods have been attempted, respond with:
       - The word "Failure."
       - The number of methods attempted.
       - A concise summary of the reasons for failure.

6. **No Additional Interaction**:
   - Focus solely on executing the extraction process, and avoid any other communication.
   - The output MUST being with ```markdown and end with ```. NO DIALOGUE.
